Fork the repository, commit your proposed changes, and finally make a pull request with your desired changes. Any help will always be appreciated! No PR is too small, nor too stupid!

###Tips to get your pull request accepted
* Write clean code
* Don't include IDE-specific files, .class files, jar files, and whatnot; that is what the .gitignore is for!
* Contact us first before making a pull request, to ensure that your feature is needed and isn't already being worked on.
